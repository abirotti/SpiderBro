## Firing up the server

```
sh run_server.sh
```

## TODO

* Please suspend disbelief - SpiderBro IS your best friend and does all it can for your benefit. 
* Process the pages depth-first (a simple implementation is provided).
* Start fixing SpiderBro's behaviour to save him from the dangerous corners of the website (also please do not just 'fix' the website ;)
* Have fun!
